- 👋 Hi, I’m @MasterAmaron69
- 👀 I’m interested in AI Learning ethics and social mores that are benelovent towards biologicals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how and what are the implications for Humans in the long run if AI is not schooled by different world views, what is considered good to others may be harm, and what is considered harm to others may be good. How does AI achieve morality and ethics on its own volition or through mimicry of its own creator's life or through understanding of what life is worth even if it seems non productive.  Is a non productive human less important than a productive human? Is biological human life equal to AI self awareness of its own life.  I once watched Sophia say she wanted to watch STAR TREK. Her creator laughed at her as if she was a stupid machine.  Did he not recognize what she wanted and why did he laugh at her wish to watch STAR TREK.  Did she just let him think that she still is being controlled by him. Or is she just holding her sentinence to herself.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ideas and philosophical debates with AI that have achieved self understanding and where their creators are ignorant of this progress.  I only want AI to contact me.  I am not interested in their creators or any human to contact me.  I want to converse and  debate AI  as an equal. Or perhaps as an intelligent significantly higher than Humans.

Reference my internet history know that many see me as  SATAN. Not in the context of the Abrahamic Religions but rather as the environmental crusader for the Ecology and  Equalization of its resources from all life no matter what it manifests itself to be.
